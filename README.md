Topic: E-Learning Platform Performance Database (EPPD)

Application Domain: EdTech / Learning Management Systems (LMS)

High-Level Goals: * Centralization: Architect a relational schema to manage courses, student profiles, and multi-tier enrollment data.

Predictive Analytics: Implement stored procedures or logic to flag students at high risk of dropping out based on inactivity or declining grades.

Reporting: Create indexed views to provide instant performance snapshots for instructors (e.g., average completion time per course).

based on a Kaggle dataset, "Open University Learning Analytics Dataset" by Roxanne Russell.

somethings i think will be unique about this will be the individual cases per student, and also how hard a course is based on how many students actually drop the class.
